# Memory_Game
Not to boast, but this is a fairly clever take on a browser based memory game. There are lots of nice features including css animations, local storage of high scores, and more. 

I am having to move on due to the intensive nature of Springboard's coursework, but I intend to come back and improve the overall plain look of the game setting. But don't you be thrown off by the first appearance, there is plenty there, so enjoy!
